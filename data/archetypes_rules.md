## The Physiognomist

After committing, look at the face-color of your banked dice, and find which 'humor' has the highest total:

**Red = Sanguine Hysterics:** heal 1  
**Black = Melancholic Airs:** give a player 2x regret  
**Blue = Phlegmatic Schizoid:** reroll a banked die  
**Orange = Bilious Spite:** give a player 1x neurosis  
_White faces are ignored_  
If the totals are exactly even - you can choose **any 2** of the humor abilities
